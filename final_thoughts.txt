Based on the confusion matricies, it seems like limiting the maximum depth harms the accuracy of the model.When increasing the number of predictors, the model appears to improve. Adding a cost complexity parameter seems to improve the model but only minimally.

Based on the accuracy of my best model (the gradient boosting classifier) on different numbers, it seems like the model does pretty well on predicting eights but suffers when predicting fives. This makes some sense as the number 8 has a distinct but also a pretty well defined shape compared to other numbers: two circles. The number 5 runs into the problem of looking too much like other numbers. If is bottom half appears like a circle it might be a 6, if both halves, it might be an 8.
